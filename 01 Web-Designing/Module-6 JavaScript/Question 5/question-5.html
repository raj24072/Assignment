<!-- Question
        What are undeclared and undefined variables?
    Answer:
        Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword. Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword. -->
