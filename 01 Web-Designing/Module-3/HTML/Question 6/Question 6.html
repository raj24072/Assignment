     What is class called in HTML?

The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element. Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name is case sensitive. Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.


Example:

       <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <style>
        h1.intro 
          {
         color: blue;
          }
        
        p.important
         {
          color: green;
         }
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>

        <h1 class="intro">Header 1</h1>

        <p>A paragraph.</p>
        
        <p class="important">Note that this is an important paragraph. :)</p>

        </body>
        </html>
