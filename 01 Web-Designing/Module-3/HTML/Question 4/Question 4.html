<!-- What are HTML Entities? With Example.
 
    An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).

    Example of html entities:

    Result:	|  Description:	         |          Entity Name:	  |     Entity Number:

              non-breaking space	               &nbsp;	          &#160;	
      <	      less than	                           &lt;   	          &#60;	
      >	      greater than                         &gt;	              &#62;	
      &	      ampersand	                           &amp;	          &#38;	
      "	      double quotation mark	               &quot;             &#34;
