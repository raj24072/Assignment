<!-- What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

        The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

            Example:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>

            <h1>The span element</h1>

            <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span             style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

            </body>
            </html>
