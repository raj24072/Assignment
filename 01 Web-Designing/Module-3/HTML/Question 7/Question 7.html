<!-- What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
elements? With Example.

    Remember the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
 
    Example:

    *An element with a unique id.
           <h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

    *Multiple elements with same class 

           <h2 class="city">London</h2>
           <p>London is the capital of England.</p>

           <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
           <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

           <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
           <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
