    Question:
        Canvas and SVG tags
    Answer:
        SVG:
            1)SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.

            2)SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.

            3)SVG can be modified through script and CSS.

            4)SVG is vector based and composed of shapes.

        HTML Canvas:
            1)Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.

            2)Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.

            3)Canvas can be modified through script only.

            4)Canvas is raster based and composed of pixel.
