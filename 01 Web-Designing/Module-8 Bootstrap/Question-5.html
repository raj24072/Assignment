     Question:
          What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5?
     Answer:
          The form elements in Bootstrap 4 have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5, the form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent look and feel in all browsers. The new form controls are based on completely semantic, standard form controls.
